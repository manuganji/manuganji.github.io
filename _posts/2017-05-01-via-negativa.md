There are two ways to acquire and enrich your knowledge.

The popular way is to learn about what something _is_, what is proven to work and why it works.

The other way is called Via Negativa - by describing what something is not,  what is not yet disqualified without insisting too much on explanation.

I've had a vague notion for this idea for a few years. I must credit Taleb for introducing me to this philosophy in _Antifragile_.

Via Negativa knowledge has a few advantages. Foremost, it is more robust. Something known to fail in a few scenarios can be safely ignored forever. But something that works now is still open to failure in an unforeseen situation.

Obviously, I hate project demos that show new features and make emotional pitches about future while ignoring behaviour under uncontrolled conditions.

Via Negativa avoids [Confirmationist Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias). Remember that _Idea Guy_ who misses the point that everyone in the room can see? It also avoids the [Surviorship Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) and [Narrative Fallacy](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Narrative_fallacy). It also explains why most new ideas fail. Because they have hidden fragilities.

Throughout this series, I'll point out what doesn't work. I'll probably make a list of ideas that don't work. The understanding is that all other options are open to experiment until proven wrong. This doesn't make us pessimists but helps us avoid fragilities.
