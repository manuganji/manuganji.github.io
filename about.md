Here, I share the programming stuff that I learn. Many times, it's for my own reference. It might help people stuck with similar problems. I have seen a lot of professional growth due to the efforts of various opensource communities. This is my small way of giving back.

I love elegant stuff like Python which abstract away the needless complexity. These days, I'm spending a lot of time with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Meteor](http://meteor.com), [Python](http://python.org) and [Django](http://djangoproject.com)
