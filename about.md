Here, I share the programming stuff that I learn. Many times, it's for my own reference. It might help people stuck with similar problems. I have seen a lot of professional growth due to the efforts of various opensource communities. This is my small way of giving back.

I love elegant stuff like Python which abstract away the needless complexity. Programming is not my biggest passion. But I _code_ because I _get_ it. That may be because I'm good at logic and can understand pretty complex ideas in a reasonable amount of time. These days, I'm spending a lot of time with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Meteor](http://meteor.com), [Python](http://python.org) and [Django](http://djangoproject.com)

# Toolkit 

* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) with the [ultimate Vim configuration](http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html)
* I work in [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) almost all the time

# Skillset

* Python, Django
* Meteor
* HTML, CSS, JS, Lua, KonyOne 

# Reaching me
